<h3 align = "center">About Me</h3>
<p>
<p>I am from Michigan and I lived in a town near Detroit. I graduated from MSU in 2012 with a
degree in Linguistics and a minor in Spanish. Why am I 
in South Carolina now? Well my girlfriend got a teaching job down here
and I had nothing keeping me in Michigan. The weather is much nicer here, but I do
miss the cold temperatures and snow occasionally. I am taking this class to 
prepare me for graduate school. I applied to the computational linguistics
program at Brandeis University in Boston and I hope to do research in the Speech
Recognition field. I am very excited for this class!</p>
